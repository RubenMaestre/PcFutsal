We are not just a simple results website: we are the place where data becomes stories, players become legends and statistics become locker room conversations.",
      "paragraph2": "Here you will find everything you need to know about amateur futsal: rankings updated to the second, results of every match, FIFA-style player rankings, complete profiles of clubs and players, and even a rating system that would make EA Sports algorithms cry. All updated automatically when the Federation publishes official data, because we are that efficient (and a bit data geeks).",
      "paragraph3": "But this is not just for viewing results. You can explore player profiles with their complete statistics, follow your favorite team's streak, discover who is the season's top scorer or simply get lost browsing through data. And if you're up for it, you'll soon be able to play fantasy, vote for the best player of the matchday and even claim your own profile if you're a player. Because here, data has personality."

      "paragraph2": "Data is automatically updated when the Federation publishes official results. No waiting, no delays: as soon as the FFCV updates their systems, we reflect those changes here. Technology at the service of futsal, basically.",
      "paragraph3": "In this section you can see the complete ranking of any group, filter by competition, follow your favorite team's evolution and even compare statistics between teams. All with a clean and easy-to-read design, because we believe data should be accessible, not a puzzle."
    },
    "rankings": {
      "title": "How Rankings Work",
      "paragraph1": "Rankings in PC FUTSAL are not generated with a calculator and good wishes. We use an advanced rating system that analyzes each player's real performance: goals, assists, cards, matches played and even the context of each match. It's like having a virtual scout that never sleeps.",
      "paragraph2": "The 'rating' is our way of measuring a player's level. It's not just a nice number: it takes into account their historical performance, current form, their impact on the team and even their consistency. A player with a high rating is not just good, they are consistently good. And that, in futsal, is worth its weight in gold (or in points, which is the same).",
      "paragraph3": "Ratings are updated after each matchday, reflecting the most recent performance. A good match can raise your rating, a bad day can lower it. It is real life, but with numbers. And yes, we know you love to see how your favorite player's rating goes up or down. We don't judge you."
    },
    "club": {
      "title": "Club Profile",
      "paragraph1": "Each club in PC FUTSAL has its own digital identity. Here you will find all relevant information: logo, municipality, venue where they play, current position in the league, results streak (the one that excites or worries you so much) and the latest matches played.",
      "paragraph2": "But we don't stop at the basics. You can also see the club's complete squad, with all registered players, their individual statistics and even their detailed profiles if you want to dig deeper. It's like having the match program, but improved with real-time data and without having to fold it to fit in your pocket.",
      "paragraph3": "This section is your starting point to learn everything about a club: its recent history, its star players, its performance in the current season and even its rating coefficient. Because in PC FUTSAL, each club tells its own story through data."
